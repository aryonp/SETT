I assume you already have a fully installed linux box.

### Installation

Just run below command or copy paste it and it will run everything automatically

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aryonp/SETT/master/install.sh > ~/install.sh && sudo bash ~/install.sh

```
 
Feel free to use this script and leave comments.
